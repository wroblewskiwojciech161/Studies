"Thank  you!"  said  Bilbo with  a  gasp.  It was  not  the  correct  thing  to  say,  but 
they have begun  to  arrive had  flustered him badly. He  liked visitors, but he  liked 
to know  them before  they arrived, and he preferred  to ask  them himself. He had a 
horrible  thought  that  the  cakes might  run  short,  and  then  he-as  the host: he knew 
his duty and stuck to it however painful-he might have to go without. 
"Come  along  in,  and  have  some  tea!"  he  managed  to  say  after  taking  a  deep 
breath. 

####-"A  little  beer  would  suit  me  better,  if  it  is  all  the  same  to  you, my  good  sir," 
said  Balin  with  the  white  beard.  "But  I  don't  mind  some  cake-seed-cake,  if  you 
have any." 
"Lots!"  Bilbo  found  himself  answering,  to  his  own  surprise;  and  he  found 
himself  scuttling  off,  too,  to  the  cellar  to  fill  a  pint  beer-mug, and to the pantry to 
fetch  two  beautiful  round  seed-cakes  which  he  had  baked  that  afternoon  for  his 
after-supper morsel. 
When he got back Balin and Dwalin were  talking at  the  table  like old  friends 
(as  a  matter  of  fact  they  were  brothers).  Bilbo  plumped  down  the  beer  and  the 
cake  in  front  of  them, when  loud  came  a  ring  at  the  bell  again,  and  then  another 
ring. 
"Gandalf for certain this time," he thought as he puffed along the passage. But 
it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow 
beards;  and  each  of  them  carried  a  bag  of  tools  and  a  spade.  In  they  hopped,  as 
soon as the door began to open-Bilbo was hardly surprised at all. 
"What can I do for you, my dwarves?" he said. "Kili at your service!" said the 
one.  "And  Fili!"  added  the  other;  and  they  both  swept  off  their  blue  hoods  and 
bowed. 
"At  yours  and  your  family's!"  replied  Bilbo,  remembering  his  manners  this 
time. 
"Dwalin and Balin here already, I see," said Kili. "Let us join the throng!" 
"Throng!" thought Mr. Baggins. "I don't like the sound of that. I really must sit 
down for a minute and collect my wits, and have a drink." He had only just had a 
sip-in  the  corner,  while  the  four  dwarves  sat  around  the  table,  and  talked  about 
mines  and  gold  and  troubles  with  the  goblins,  and  the  depredations  of  dragons, 
and lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want to, for they 
sounded much too adventurous-when, ding-dong-a-ling-' dang, his bell rang again, 
as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. "Someone at 
the  door!"  he  said,  blinking.  "Some  four,  I  should  say  by  the  sound,"  said  Fili. 
"Be-sides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance." 
The  poor  little  hobbit  sat  down  in  the  hall  and  put  his  head  in  his  hands,  and 
wondered  what  had  happened,  and  what  was  going  to  happen,  and  whether  they 
would all stay  to supper. Then  the bell ranhe River. 
     'Why,  this  is  the Stock-brook!' said Pippin. 'If we are going to try 
and get back on to our course, we must  cross at once and bear right.' 
     They waded  the  stream, and hurried over a wide open space, rush-grown 
and treeless, on the  further side. Beyond that they came again to a belt of 
trees: tall oaks, for the most part, with here  and there an elm tree or  an 
ash. The ground was fairly level, and  there was little undergrowth; but the 
trees were loo close for them to see far  ahead.  The leaves blew upwards in 
sudden gusts of wind, and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky. 
Then the wind died  away and the rain came streaming down. They trudged 
along 
as fast as they could, over patches of grass, and through  thick  drifts  of 
old leaves; and all about them the rain pattered  and trickled. They did not 
talk, but kept glancing back, and from side to side. 
     After  half an hour Pippin said: 'I hope  we  have not turned  too much 
towards the south, and are not walking longwise through this wood! It is not  
a very broad belt --I should  have said  no more than a mile at the widest  - 
and we ought to have been through it by now.' 
     'It is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,' said Frodo. 'That won't  
mend  matters. Let us keep on as we  are going! I am not sure that I want to 
come out into the open yet.' 
     They  went on for perhaps another couple of miles. Then the sun gleamed 
out of ragged clouds  again and the rain  lessened. It was now past mid-day,  
and they felt it was high time for lunch. They halted under an elm tree: its 
leaves  though fast turning yellow were still thick, and the  ground at  its 
feel  was fairly dry and sheltered. When  they came to make their meal, they 
found that  the  Elves had  filled their bottles  with  a  clear drink, pale 
golden in colour: it had the scent of a honey made  of many flowers, and was 
wonderfully  refreshing. Very soon they  were  laughing, and snapping  their  
fingers at rain, and at Black Riders.  The last few  miles, they felt, would 
soon be behind them. 

####-     Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. Sam 
and Pippin sat near, and they began to hum, and then to sing softly: 
     Ho! Ho! Ho! to the bottle I go 
     To heal my heart and drown my woe. 
     Rain may fall and wind may blow,  
     And many miles be still to go, 
     But under a tall tree I will lie, 
     And let the clouds go sailing by. 
     Ho! Ho! Ho! they began again louder. They stopped short suddenly. Frodo 
sprang to his feet. A long-drawn wail came  down the wind, like  the  cry of 
some evil  and  lonely  creature.  It  rose and fell, and  ended  on  a high 
piercing  note. Even as  they sat and stood, as  if suddenly frozen,  it was 
answered by another  cry, fainter and further off, but no less  chilling  to 
the blood. There was then a silence, broken only by the sound of the wind in 
the leaves. 
     'And what do you think that was?' Pippin asked at last, trying to speak 
lightly, but quavering a little. 'If it was a bird, it was  one that I never  
heard in the Shire before.' 
     'It was not bipantry. He had only  just had break  fast, but he  thought a cake or  two and a drink 
of  something  would  do  him  good  after  his  fright.  Gandalf  in  the  meantime  was 
still  standing  outside  the  door,  and  laughing  long  but  quietly.  After  a  while  he 
stepped  up,  and  with  the  spike  of  his  staff  scratched  a  queer  sign  on  the  hobbit's 
beautiful  green  front-door.  Then  he  strode  away,  just  about  the  time  when  Bilbo 
Dwalin's  green  hood  hanging  up.  He  hung  his  red  one  next  to  it,  and  "Balin  at 
your service!" he said with his hand on his breast. 
"Thank  you!"  said  Bilbo with  a  gasp.  It was  not  the  correct  thing  to  say,  but 
they have begun  to  arrive had  flustered him badly. He  liked visitors, but he  liked

A  big  jug  of  coffee  bad  just  been  set  in  the  hearth,  the  seed-cakes were gone, 
and  the  dwarves  were  starting  on  a  round  of  buttered  scones,  when  there  came-a 
loud  knock.  Not  a  ring,  but  a  hard  rat-tat  on  the  hobbit's  beautiful  green  door. 
Somebody was banging with a stick! 
Bilbo  rushed  along  the  passage,  very  angry,  and  altogether  bewildered  and 
bewuthered-this  was  the  most  awkward  Wednesday  he  ever  remembered.  He 
pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More 
dwarves,  four  more!  And  there  was  Gandalf  behind,  leaning  on  his  staff  and 
laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, 
knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before. 
"Carefully!  Carefully!"  he  said.  "It  is  not  like  you,  Bilbo,  to  keep  friends 
waiting  on  the  mat,  and  then  open  the  door  like  a  pop-gun!  Let  me  introduce 
Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!" 
"At your service!" said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they 
hung  up  two  yellow  hoods  and  a  pale  green  one;  and  also  a  sky-blue one with  a 
long silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in 
fact  no  other  than  the  great  Thorin  Oakenshield  himself,  who  was  not  at  all 
pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. 
For  one  thing  Bombur  was  immensely  fat  and  heavy.  Thorin  indeed  was  very 
haughty,  and  said  nothing  about  service;  but  poor Mr. Baggins  said  he was  sorry 
so  many  times,  that  at  last  he  grunted  "pray  don't  mention  it,"  and  stopped 
frowning. 
"Now we  are  all here!"  said Gandalf,  looking  at  the  row of  thirteen hoods-the 
best  detachable  party  hoods-and his own hat hanging on  the pegs. "Quite a merry 
gathering! 
I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What's that? 
Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, I think, for me." "And for me," said Thorin. 
"And raspberry jam and apple-tart," said Bifur. "And mince-pies and cheese," said   soon  two  purple  hoods,  a 

####-grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they 
marched  with  their  broad  hands  stuck  in  their  gold  and  silver  belts  to  join  the 
others. Already  it had almost become a  throng. Some called  for ale, and some  for 
porter,  and  one  for  coffee,  and  all  of  them  for  cakes;  so  the hobbit was kept very

bowed. 
"At  yours  and  your  family's!"  replied  Bilbo,  remembering  his  manners  this 
time. 
"Dwalin and Balin here already, I see," said Kili. "Let us join the throng!" 
"Throng!" thought Mr. Baggins. "I don't like the sound of that. I really must sit 
down for a minute and collect my wits, and have a drink." He had only just had a 
sip-in  the  corner,  while  the  four  dwarves  sat  around  the  table,  and  talked  about 
mines  and  gold  and  troubles  with  the  goblins,  and  the  depredations  of  dragons, 
and lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want to, for they 
sounded much too adventurous-when, ding-dong-a-ling-' dang, his bell rang again, 
as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. "Someone at 
the  door!"  he  said,  blinking. "Dwalin and Balin here already, I see," said Kili. "Let us join the throng!" 
"Throng!" thought Mr. Baggins. "I don't like the sound of that. I really must sit

as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. "Someone at 
the  door!"  he  said,  blinking.  "Some  four,  I  should  say  by  the  sound,"  said  Fili. 
"Be-sides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance." 
The  poor  little  hobbit  sat  down  in  the  hall  and  put  his  head  in  his  hands,  and 
wondered  what  had  happened,  and  what  was  going  to  happen,  and  whether  they 
would all stay  to supper. Then  the bell rang again  louder  than ever, and he had  to 
run  to  the  door.  It  was  not  four  after  all,  t  was  FIVE.  Another  dwarf  had  come 
along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, be-x)re 
they were all  inside, bowing and  saying  "at your  service" one after another. Dori, 
Nori,  Ori,  Oin,  and  Gloin  were  their  names;  and  very  soon  two  purple  hoods,  a 

####-grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they 
marched  with  their  broad  hands  stuck  in  their  gold  and  silver  belts  to  join  the 
others. Already  it had almost become a  throng. Some called  for ale, and some  for 
porter,  and  one  for  coffee,  and  all  of  them  for  cakes;  so  the hobbit was kept very 
busy for a while. 
"Lots!"  Bilbo  found  himself  answering,  to  his  own  surprise;  and  he  found 
himself  scuttling  off,  too,  to  the  cellar  to  fill  a  pint  beer-mug, and to the pantry to 
fetch  two  beautiful  round  seed-cakes  which  he  had  baked  that  afternoon  for  his 
after-supper morsel. 
When he got back Balin and Dwalin were  talking at  the  table  like old  friends 
(as  a  matter  of  fact  they  were  brothers).  Bilbo  plumped  down  the  beer  and  the 
cake  in  front  of  them, when  loud  came  a  ring  at  the  bell  again,  and  then  another 
ring. 
"Gandalf for certain this time," he thought as he puffed along the passage. But 
it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow 
beards;  and  each  of  them  carried  a  bag  of  tools  and  a  spade.  In  they  hopped,  as 
soon as the door began to open-Bilbo was hardly surprised at all. 
"What can I do for you, my dwarves?" he said. "Kili at your service!" said the 
one.  "And  Fili!"  added  the  other;  and  they  both  swept  off  their  blue  hoods  and 
bowed. 
"At  yours  and  your  family's!"  replied  Bilbo,  remembering  his  manners  this

A  big  jug  of  coffee  bad  just  been  set  in  the  hearth,  the  seed-cakes were gone, 
and  the  dwarves  were  starting  on  a  round  of  buttered  scones,  when  there  came-a 
loud  knock.  Not  a  ring,  but  a  hard  rat-tat  on  the  hobbit's  beautiful  green  door. 
Somebody was banging with a stick! 
Bilbo  rushed  along  the  passage,  very  angry,  and  altogether  bewildered  and 
bewuthered-this  was  the  most  awkward  Wednesday  he  ever  remembered.  He 
pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More 
dwarves,  four  more!  And  there  was  Gandalf  behind,  leaning  on  his  staff  and 
laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, 
knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before. 
"Carefully!  Carefully!"  he  said.  "It  is  not  like  you,  Bilbo,  to  keep  friends 
waiting  on  the  mat,  and  then  open  the  door  like  a  pop-gun!  Let  me  introduce 
Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!" 
"At your service!" said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they 
hung  up  two  yellow  hoods  and  a  pale  green  one;  and  also  a  sky-blue one with  a 
long silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in 
fact  no  other  than  the  great  Thorin  Oakenshield  himself,  who  was  not  at  all 
pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. 
For  one  thing  Bombur  was  immensely  fat  and  heavy.  Thorin  indeed  was  very 
haughty,  and  said  nothing  about  service;  but  poor Mr. Baggins  said  he was  sorry 
so  many  times,  that  at  last  he  grunted  "pray  don't  mention  it,"  and  stopped 
frowning. 
"Now we  are  all here!"  said Gandalf,  looking  at  the  row of  thirteen hoods-the 
best  detachable  party  hoods-and his own hat hanging on  the pegs. "Quite a merry 
gathering! 
I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What's that? 
Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, I think, for me." "And for me," said Thorin. 
"And raspberry jam and apple-tart," said Bifur. "And mince-pies and cheese," said  "Some  four,  I  should  say  by  the  sound,"  said  Fili. 
"Be-sides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance."

The  poor  little  hobbit  sat  down  in  the  hall  and  put  his  head  in  his  hands,  and 
wondered  what  had  happened,  and  what  was  going  to  happen,  and  whether  they 
would all stay  to supper. Then  the bell rang again  louder  than ever, and he had  to 
run  to  the  door.  It  was  not  four  after  all,  t  was  FIVE.  Another  dwarf  had  come 
along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, be-x)re 
they were all  inside, bowing and  saying  "at your  service" one after another. Dori, 
Nori,  Ori,  Oin,  and  Gloin  were  their  names;  and  very  soon  two  purple  hoods,  a 

####-grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they 
marched  with  their  broad  hands  stuck  in  their  gold  and  silver  belts  to  join  the 
others. Already  it had almost become a  throng. Some called  for ale, and some  for 
porter,  and  one  for  coffee,  and  all  of  them  for  cakes;  so  the hobbit was kept very 
busy for a while. g again  louder  than ever, and he had  to

porter,  and  one  for  coffee,  and  all  of  them  for  cakes;  so  the hobbit was kept very 
busy for a while. 
A  big  jug  of  coffee  bad  just  been  set  in  the  hearth,  the  seed-cakes were gone, 
and  the  dwarves  were  starting  on  a  round  of  buttered  scones,  when  there  came-a 
loud  knock.  Not  a  ring,  but  a  hard  rat-tat  on  the  hobbit's  beautiful  green  door. 
Somebody was banging with a stick! 
Bilbo  rushed  along  the  passage,  very  angry,  and  altogether  bewildered  and 
bewuthered-this  was  the  most  awkward  Wednesday  he  ever  remembered.  He 
pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More 
dwarves,  four  more!  And  there  was  Gandalf  behind,  leaning  on  his  staff  and 
laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, 
knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before. 
"Carefully!  Carefully!"  he  said.  "It  is  not  like  you,  Bilbo,  to  keep  friends 
waiting  on  the  mat,  and  then  open  the  door  like  a  pop-gun!  Let  me  introduce 
Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!" 
"At your service!" said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they 
hung  up  two  yellow  hoods  and  a  pale  green  one;  and  also  a  sky-blue one with  a 
long silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in 
fact  no  other  than  the  great  Thorin  Oakenshield  himself,  who  was  not  at  all 
pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. 
For  one  thing  Bombur  was  immensely  fat  and  heavy.  Thorin  indeed  was  very 
haughty,  and  said  nothing  about  service;  but  poor Mr. Baggins  said  he was  sorry 
so  many  times,  that  at  last  he  grunted  "pray  don't  mention  it,"  and  stopped 
frowning. 
"Now we  are  all here!"  said Gandalf,  looking  at  the  row of  thirteen hoods-the 
best  detachable  party  hoods-and his own hat hanging on  the pegs. "Quite a merry 
gathering! 
I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What's that? 
Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, I think, for me." "And for me," said Thorin. 
"And raspberry jam and apple-tart," said Bifur. "And mince-pies and cheese," said   thirteen hoods-the 
best  detachable  party  hoods-and his own hat hanging on  the pegs. "Quite a merry 
gathering! 
I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What's that?

soon as the door began to open-Bilbo was hardly surprised at all. 
"What can I do for you, my dwarves?" he said. "Kili at your service!" said the 
one.  "And  Fili!"  added  the  other;  and  they  both  swept  off  their  blue  hoods  and 
bowed. 
"At  yours  and  your  family's!"  replied  Bilbo,  remembering  his  manners  this 
time. 
"Dwalin and Balin here already, I see," said Kili. "Let us join the throng!" 
"Throng!" thought Mr. Baggins. "I don't like the sound of that. I really must sit 
down for a minute and collect my wits, and have a drink." He had only just had a 
sip-in  the  corner,  while  the  four  dwarves  sat  around  the  table,  and  talked  about 
mines  and  gold  and  troubles  with  the  goblins,  and  the  depredations  of  dragons, 
and lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want to, for they 
sounded much too adventurous-when, ding-dong-a-ling-' dang, his bell rang again, 
as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. "Someone at 
the  door!"  he  said,  blinking.  "Some  four,  I  should  say  by  the  sound,"  said  Fili. 
"Be-sides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance." 
The  poor  little  hobbit  sat  down  in  the  hall  and  put  his  head  in  his  hands,  and
